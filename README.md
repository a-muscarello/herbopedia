Created using Ruby 2.5.1

Final Project for the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline's Web Development Fellowship Program (June 2018). 

Organize and create a unique MVP web product that is fully operational and uses a piece of technology you have not been taught in the classroom. This can be anything from a gem, a javascript library or a frontend framework. 

Create a self-directed learning plan for yourself to hold yourself accountable after you leave this program.
